    <h1>Privacy Policy for Sikh Kids Music App</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 12, 2025</p>
    <p>Welcome to the Sikh Kids Music App ("the App"), a music streaming service designed for children to enjoy Sikh Gurus, martyrs, and Gurbani-related content. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our App, hosted on GitHub Pages. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy, especially as our App is intended for young users.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>No Account or Login Required:</strong> The App does not require users to create an account or log in, so we do not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or passwords.</p>
    <p><strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong> We may collect non-personal, aggregated data to improve the App’s functionality, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device information (e.g., device type, operating system version).</li>
      <li>Usage data (e.g., which songs or content are streamed, app interactions).</li>
      <li>General location data (e.g., country or region, derived from IP addresses).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify individual users.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use non-personal information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhance the App’s performance and user experience.</li>
      <li>Analyze usage trends to improve content and features.</li>
      <li>Ensure the App operates smoothly on various devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share personal information, as no personal data is collected. Non-personal, aggregated data may be shared with third-party service providers (e.g., analytics or hosting services like GitHub Pages) to support the App’s functionality. These providers are contractually obligated to protect the data and use it only for the services they provide to us.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App is hosted on GitHub Pages, which may collect certain technical data (e.g., IP addresses) as part of its standard operations. For details, please review <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection">GitHub Pages’ data collection policies</a>.</p>
    <p>We may use analytics tools to understand App usage. These tools collect only anonymized data and comply with privacy regulations suitable for apps aimed at children.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is designed for Sikh children and complies with applicable children’s privacy laws, such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Since no personal information is collected and no login is required, we minimize privacy risks for our young users.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the limited data we collect. However, no online service is completely secure, and we encourage parents to supervise their children’s use of the App.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain non-personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy (e.g., improving the App). Anonymized data may be retained indefinitely for analytics purposes.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on this page, and the “Effective Date” will be revised. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
    <p>Email: <a href="mailto:gurvinderp84@gmail.com">gurvinderp84@gmail.com</a></p>
    <p>We aim to respond to inquiries within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
